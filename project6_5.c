/*
   Programming Project 1 in Chapter 4 asked you to write a program that
   displays a two-digit number with its digits reversed. Generalize the 
   program so that the number can have one, two, three or more digits.
   Hint: Use a do loop that repeatedly divides the number by 10, stopping
   when it reaches 0.

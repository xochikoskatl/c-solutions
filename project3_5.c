/*
	Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any
	order) and then displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the
	sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

		Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
		16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

		16  3  2 13
		 5 10 11  8
		 9  6  7 12
		 4 15 14  1

		Row sums: 34 34 34 34
		Column sums: 34 34 34 34
		Diagonal sums: 34 34

	If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the sam (as they are in this
	example), the members are said to form a magic square. The magic square shown
	here appears in a 1514 engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht DÃ¼rer.
	(Note that the middle numbers in the last row give the date of the 
	engraving.)
